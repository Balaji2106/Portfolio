            <h1>Project-1</h1>
            <p>This project involves creating a fire detection system using image processing techniques implemented on a Raspberry Pi. The system is designed to monitor environments for potential fire hazards by analyzing video feeds in real-time. Leveraging the processing power of the Raspberry Pi, this low-cost and efficient system provides an effective solution for early fire detection, particularly in areas where traditional fire detection systems may not be feasible.</p>
            <p>Key Features: <br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Real-Time Fire Detection: The system processes live video feeds captured by a camera module connected to the Raspberry Pi, detecting fire outbreaks based on color and motion &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;analysis.</p>
               <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alert Mechanism: Upon detecting fire, the system can be programmed to trigger alarms, send notifications via email or SMS, or activate other safety protocols, ensuring a <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quick  response   to potential dangers.

            <h1>Project-2</h1>
            <p>This project involves the development of a Virtual Assistant designed to enhance productivity and streamline daily tasks through voice-controlled interactions. The assistant leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user commands, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.</p>
            <p>Key Features: <br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice Activation: The Virtual Assistant is activated through a customizable wake word, allowing hands-free operation. Once activated, it listens for user commands and processes them  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in real-time.</p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Device Control: The assistant can control various aspects of the user's device, such as adjusting volume, managing settings, and launching applications, enhancing the overall user <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; experience.

            <h1>Project-3</h1>
            <p>This project explores the implementation of image multiplication using a 4-2 compressor, a technique commonly used in digital signal processing and VLSI design to efficiently multiply binary numbers. The 4-2 compressor is a specialized circuit that reduces the number of partial products generated during multiplication, leading to faster and more efficient computations, particularly in image processing applications.</p>
            <p>Key Features: <br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4-2 Compressor Circuit: The core of the project is the design and implementation of a 4-2 compressor circuit, which takes four input bits and produces &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two output bits, along with a carry bit. This compressor is used to optimize the partial product reduction stage in the multiplication process.</p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Image Multiplication: The project applies the 4-2 compressor in the context of multiplying two images, typically represented as matrices of pixel values.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each pixel's intensity value is treated as a binary number, and the multiplication is performed at the pixel level.
